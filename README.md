+ **Project summary**: In this project, we develop an app demo to intergrate off-campus housing options and various factors university students may concern about while seeking off-campus housing. App is divided into two main pages: Housing Explorer  and Recommendation. 

    Housing explorer tab shows rental house or apartment information in Manhattan area. Users have flexible search choices based on bedroom numbers, bathroom numbers and budget. To make search easier, the Tab also map out restaurant, transportation, market and safety condition nearby.

    Recommendation tab offers customed neighborhood recommendation for Columbia, NYU and Fordham University students. We offer five choices that students usually take into consideration while seeking off-campus housing. Users could choose top three preference among average rental price, safety, distance to school, market and restaurant.
